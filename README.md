# useful-tidbits
There are a lot of bits of code that I find I have to write way too often and I'm sick of it.  I'm gonna start dropping these bits in here so I have easy access to them as needed.  Be aware than most of this content will be in C#.  If I dive into any other languages regularly, I'll be sure to call those out as I add them.

I'll be organizing the repository along topics or particular technologies, with each topic holding a root-level folder, which will be further organized into sub-topics.

## Topics
### [Messaging](/messaging/README.md)  
In this topic, I explore message based architecture, along with discussing tradeoffs.  I'll keep my Useful Tidbits that I find myself typing in too much in here as well.
